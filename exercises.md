### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
Mostly nonfiction, some autofiction

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I rabbit hole on something until I'm overwhelmed by the information and emotion of it all and then I lay it out in a (shitty) first draft. I write digitally, mostly using Notion or Word. And then I leave it and think about it and add and refine and rinse and repeat until I get something semi-coherent.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I think when I write by hand the pace suits my brain better, and I find it easier to get into 'flow'. But I think Notion has been good for organising chaotic notes. Everything is accessible and I can add



## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- It needs a screen, print lit can be on a screen but doesn't have to. 
- There is writing that is content and there is writing that's scaffolding. 
- Oh wow, everyone else put actual definitions together.
- There's no money in it, like, less than print lit!
### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?
- Interactivity
- Heaps more variations in the text/experience
- Accessibility
- More avenues for second person
- More expansive storylines
